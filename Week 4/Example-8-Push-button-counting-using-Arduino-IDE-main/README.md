# Example-8-Push-button-counting-using-Arduino-IDE
Hello everyone! <br/>
This coding will count each number by each number when the push button (PB) being pressed.<br/>
As an example, when PB1 being pressed once, it will display number "1".<br/>
When the PB1 being pressed once again it will display "2".<br/>
Hope this coding will help you! Thank you. <br/>
